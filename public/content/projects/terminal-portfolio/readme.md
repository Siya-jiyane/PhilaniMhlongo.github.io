# Terminal Portfolio Website

> An interactive terminal-style portfolio website - my first dive into modern web development!

## ✨ About

This portfolio was a "vibe coding" project - I challenged myself to learn React, TypeScript, and modern web development while creating something unique to showcase my professional journey. As someone with a background in IT administration, this was completely outside my comfort zone, but that's exactly why I built it.

The site mimics a Unix-like terminal environment, allowing visitors to explore my work experience, skills, and projects using familiar commands like `ls`, `cd`, and `cat`.

## 🚀 What I Learned

This project was a massive learning experience for me:

- **React Fundamentals**: Components, hooks, state management, and props
- **TypeScript**: Type safety, interfaces, and better developer experience
- **Modern CSS**: Tailwind utility classes and responsive design
- **Animation**: Creating smooth transitions with Framer Motion
- **File System Simulation**: Building a virtual file system in the browser
- **Project Structure**: Organizing a modern web application
- **Git Workflow**: Version control for web development projects

### The Challenge

Coming from a systems administration background, frontend development was completely new territory. I had to learn:
- How modern JavaScript frameworks work
- Component-based architecture
- CSS-in-JS concepts
- Build tools and development workflows
- Deployment to GitHub Pages

### Why I Built This

1. **Learning Challenge**: Wanted to prove I could pick up new technologies quickly
2. **Career Transition**: Demonstrating adaptability as I move toward DevOps
3. **Unique Presentation**: Standing out from traditional portfolio websites
4. **Technical Growth**: Expanding beyond my comfort zone of server administration

## 💭 Reflection

This project taught me that stepping outside your comfort zone is where real growth happens. While I'm still learning web development, building this portfolio showed me that my problem-solving skills from IT administration translate well to software development.

It's also a reminder that in tech, being willing to learn and adapt is just as important as what you already know.
