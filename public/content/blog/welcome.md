# Welcome to My Journey

**Welcome to my corner of the internet.**

I'm Siyabonga Jiyane, a DevOps Engineer with 4+ years of experience in enterprise infrastructure and cloud environments. This blog is where I document my experiences, share insights from my day-to-day work, and hopefully help others who are on a similar journey in the DevOps world.

## 🌱 Why DevOps?

Coming from a systems administration background, I've evolved from being the person who fixes things when they break to someone who builds systems that prevent problems from happening in the first place - through automation, better processes, and smarter infrastructure design.

DevOps represents the perfect blend of my existing systems knowledge with modern software delivery practices. It's about enabling teams to move faster while maintaining reliability, and that's something I'm passionate about.
