### About This Portfolio
**Full transparency**: This terminal-style portfolio was "vibe coded" as a learning project! While I'm experienced in systems administration and cloud infrastructure, many of the modern web development technologies used here (React, TypeScript, advanced CSS) are new to me. I built this to challenge myself, learn something completely different, and showcase my ability to adapt and pick up new technologies quickly.

The project demonstrates my willingness to step outside my comfort zone and explore areas beyond traditional IT administration - a mindset I believe is essential for a successful DevOps career.
